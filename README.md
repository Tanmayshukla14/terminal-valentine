# 💻💖 Terminal Valentine  
### A Nerdy Developer-Themed Valentine Website

Perfect as a fun project, a teaching demo, or a creative portfolio piece.

## 🎯 Features

💕 **Interactive logic** — The “No” button refuses to cooperate  
🎊 **Confetti celebration** — Canvas animation when they say yes  
💻 **Tech humor** — Error messages, git jokes, and coding references  
📱 **Responsive design** — Works smoothly on desktop & mobile  
🎓 **Beginner-friendly** — Clean, well-commented source code  
🚀 **Zero dependencies** — Pure vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
⌨️ **Keyboard shortcuts** — Press **Y** or **N** for hidden fun

## 🖼️ What Happens on the Page?

When someone opens the site:

- A fake terminal window asks the Valentine question
- Two buttons appear: **Yes** and **No**
- The **No** button shakes, runs away, and eventually disables itself
- Clicking **Yes** triggers a success screen + confetti animation
- Console easter eggs reward curious developers 👀

It’s basically a tiny interactive game disguised as a love letter.
